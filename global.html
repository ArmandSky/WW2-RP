      <h2>Spanish Civil War: Battles Commence!</h2>
      <p>
       In a co-ordinated strike after several months of the frontline appearing stable and not much fighting taking place.
       The War has gone into full effect. A combined Nationalist Spanish, German, Japanese & American Task Force Have navally blockaded
       Republican Spain, making any route for aid nearly impossible!. The Republican Spanish although having a larger Army in terms of manpower
       face a determined and newly equipped Nationalist Spanish Force, with Volunteers from several nations backing them.
      <br><br>
       Update:
       5th of September 1936: After a few short days of fighting, elements of the Nationalist Spanish First Army, spearheaded by elements of the 1st & 3rd Panzer Divisions 
       of Germany, swiftly struck at the flank of the capital of Madrid itself battling the Guadalajara based 5th Loyalist Army of Republican Spanish. Although they fought bravely!
       The sheer firepower & ferocity of the Panzer divisions supported by Infantry & Artillery from the 1st Nationalist Spanish Army, routed and defeated the 5th Loyalist Army.
       Reports are still coming in, however initial reports state that atleast 90% of the 5th Loyalist Army was either killed or wounded or captured in this swift strike, leaving the 
       right flank of Republican Spain guarding Madrid extremely vulnerable & with precious few and outdated tanks themselves, One wonders if this will be the first result of many 
       of such losses to come for the Republican Army.

      <h2>Royalty Dethroned!!!</h2>
      <p>
      In a stunning Revelation that unfolded in London today, Prime Minister Baldwin, with the assistance of the top Military Leaders of Great Britain have usurped and dethroned the Royal
      family, whose reign has lasted roughly 800 years! Citing their reasonings for this drastic measure, the betrayal of allies as well as the backstabbing of economic & Military partners
      over the last several years, which in fact was not decisions made by Prime Ministers but by the Crown themselves, saying their actions have caused doubt among all the leaders of the world
      Britain's honesty and integrity and caused severe harm to it's International relations. The Prime Minister formally addressed the press on the 7th of September 1936 saying: 
      " We of the parliament stand in full support of Prime minister Baldwin in his endeavors to right the wrongs of our dearly departed royal family. In their quest to solidify Britain as the great nation 
      it is they were led astray from our goals as a people. We the parliament believe we speak for the british populous when we say that our needs as a nation far outweigh our needs to police the world. 
      While this was a drastic change we are firmly confident there is a bright future ahead of us. Simultaneously we urge the british people to have faith during this time and ask nations abroad to not hold
       against us the wrongs of our previous leadership."  
       <br><br>
       The British people are in a state of shock and confusion, many see this as a new dawn for Great Britain, however there are Loyalists to the crown who call this a heinous act.
       <br><br>
       The British Parliament declined to comment on the whereabouts of the Monarch and his family's whearabouts.
