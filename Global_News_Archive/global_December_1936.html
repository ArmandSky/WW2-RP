      <p>
        Madrid, Spain - Thanks in part to the significant and fast advances of Nationalist forces during the past 3 months, large swaths of Spain have been retaken
        by Nationalist and Coalition forces. Franco having captured Madrid and retaken the Government Building now plans his next steps.

        In a exclusive Interview with Franco he said the following: "We have heard the loud whispers of peace and that the ill-guided Republican Forces morale have buckled
        We have therefor called for a ceasefire during this December month as it is the month of Christmas and although both sides have their differences,
        we both value and adhere to our Faith, we have therefor called a ceasefire with an ultimatum to the Republican forces, Stand-down by the 1st of January 1937
        and no soldiers or men simply doing their duty will be harmed or reprimanded, and all political leaders will be given amnesty to leave and never return
        to Spanish Territory both mainland and abroad forever."

      <h2>Arms Expo Munich 1936</h2>
      <p>The month long Military show & expo in Munich was a massive success, with Nations from across the world
        showcased and exhibited some of their latest equipment.
        <br><br>
        Germany Stealing the limelight early, with their aerial showcase of their latest BF-109 variant and Medium Tanks, namely Panzer 3D and Panzer 4B.
        This quickly became overshadowed as Great Britain displayed their latest fighter the Supermarine Spitfire, right next to the BF-109. 
        They later performed aerial manuevers together the Spitfire & BF-109, and even performed mock dogfights, with both aircraft showing their class,
        not giving an inch for the either side, and most of the dogfights came down to the pilot or the weather. However these 2 top dogs are in a class of their
        own at the expo.
        <br><br>
        The British also sent their latest and greatest creation in the Armored field called the Matilda Mk2 Heavy Tank/Infantry Tank, which wowed audiences and pundits
        alike, with it's thick armor and powerful gun.
        <br><br>
       Japan as well as the US showcased some existing Quality equipment, However Japan caught the eye of all the onlookers with their Shiroyama-class Battleship model
       that recently went into service of the IJN, however with the model, they had a translated sign saying the following "A modern Fast Battleship capable of defeating any modern battleship. 
       (but for sure the british, no offense)". This possibly in reference to the Naval exercises that The Royal British Navy undertook with the Imperial Japanese Navy early in the month of November,
       the details of the outcome have not been made public, however, many speculate that this is a humorous nod to those exercises and the outcome of what happend in them.
       So Far no British representitives have officially responded to this sign.
        
       <br><br>
       However, Germany was the victor of the expo, if there can be such a thing, as they came away with the biggest trade deal, selling 8x PT-123 Adler-Class (Eagle) Torpedo Boats to The Kingdom of Iran.
      <br><br>
      We look forward to the next expo in June 1936, and for the draw who will be the host of this great event.

      <h2>Jane's International Defense Weekly 30 December 1936</h2>
      <p>As part of the bi-yearly defense review, the following index scores showcase the military standings of various nations based on publicly available data on their units and types. This table provides a general sense of each nationâ€™s deployment potential without implying any exact military strengths or weaknesses. <br>
        A refined algorithm has been used, also Naval Aircraft is factored into the naval score now, as they are predominantly used in the naval theater.
