      <p>The People's Republic of China has unveiled and launched 5 Ning-Hai 35 class Light Cruisers.
        China in a suprise press release has Unveiled the launch of a new ship class called the Ning-Hai 35, after the Ning-hai Light Cruiser that was sunk by a combined french-Japanese Navy during the brief but devastating Sino-Japanese Conflict. <br>

The chief Admiral of the Chinese People's Liberation Navy had this to say at the unveiling Ceremony: "China in terms of the navy has much to be proud of in terms of rebuilding our Navy, stronger than it was before. The new Ning-hai class is better and more powerful than any fielded by the PLN currently, it will provide greater firepower and weapons support, and has incorporated lessons from previous battlefield experience and is armed with modern weaponry and will for the foreseeable future act as flotilla leader in our navy."

The Ning-hai is a new ship and it wasn't just an unveiling of a concept, the Chinese launched 5 of the class as a show of their industrial potential at the same time. The available information we do have of the class is as follows:
