      <h2>1 June 1936 (Turn 30)</h2>
      <p>2nd Language woahs: President Luna has embarked on a campaign to make German the 2nd official Language in America and it has been a mixed bag of results, with certain States more open to the idea than others. <br>
      the more traditional southern states such as alabama voice their discontent with the decision, saying they don't need a second language. Whilst more business minded people say it's a prudent idea given the world stage.

      <h2>Elections are Coming!!! 7 June 1936</h2>
      <p>The Elections are 5 months out and the sentiment on everyone's lips are, who will be the next President? <br>
      Will it be the current President? President Luna has done an admirable job steering the country right out of a difficult economic and conflict ridden period and has brought some respect
      to the US armed forces. However voices calling for more isolationism compared to the co-operative nature that President Luna has embarked on foreign policy wise is circling. <br>
      This amids growing tensions on the World Stage, many people feel that staying isolated and on their own shores should be the prudent course of action. However President Luna has been effective <br>
      in brokering trade and other agreements with big countries on the world stage to make the Country's foreign policy standing better. Which concerns will mean to the average Joe? <br>
      six months left to find out.</p>
